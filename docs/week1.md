# Week 1: March 1-7
## March 1
- Setup: Rust env ready, GitHub repo live.
- Code: First Rust program done.
- Played with i32 for hash rate fun.

## March 3
- Studied: Variables (mutability, shadowing) and control flow (if, loop) via [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).
- Code: Simulated a basic mining loop with nonce and fake hash ([src/main.rs](../src/main.rs)).
- Notes: Rust’s strictness on mutability is wild but makes sense for safety.

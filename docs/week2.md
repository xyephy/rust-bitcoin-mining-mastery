# Week 2: March 13-19 - Bitcoin Dev in Rust
## March 13 (Day 8)
- Studied: Bitcoin mining basics, Ch. 1-4 [Building Bitcoin in Rust](https://braiins.com/books/building-bitcoin-in-rust).
- Code: Basic CPU miner with double SHA-256 ([projects/toy-miner/src/main.rs](../projects/toy-miner/src/main.rs)).
- Notes: Real hashing’s slow but cool—Bitcoin’s clicking!
- Code: CPU miner with difficulty check ([projects/toy-miner/src/main.rs](../projects/toy-miner/src/main.rs)).
- Notes: Fixed hex error, added real difficulty—feeling Bitcoin!

## March 14 (Days 9-11)
- Studied: 
  - Day 9: Ch. 4—miner polish, attempts.
  - Day 10: Ch. 5—node intro, TCP.
  - Day 11: Ch. 5—node block request.
- Code: 
  - Miner with attempts ([projects/toy-miner/src/main.rs](../projects/toy-miner/src/main.rs)).
  - Node with block req ([projects/simple-node/src/main.rs](../projects/simple-node/src/main.rs)).
- Notes: Crushed 3 days—miner’s tight, Hit E0277 on node fixed ? operator, now it talks!

## March 13 (Day 8)
- Studied: Bitcoin mining basics, Ch. 1-4 [Building Bitcoin in Rust](https://braiins.com/books/building-bitcoin-in-rust).
- Code: Basic CPU miner with double SHA-256 ([projects/toy-miner/src/main.rs](../projects/toy-miner/src/main.rs)).
- Notes: Real hashing’s slow but cool—Bitcoin’s clicking!
- Code: CPU miner with difficulty check ([projects/toy-miner/src/main.rs](../projects/toy-miner/src/main.rs)).
- Notes: Fixed hex error, added real difficulty—feeling Bitcoin!

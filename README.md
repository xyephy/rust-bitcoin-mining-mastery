# Rust for Bitcoin & Mining Hardware Mastery
My March 2025 journey to master Rust for Bitcoin dev and mining optimization (firmware/OS).
- Goals: Learn Rust, build Bitcoin tools, contribute to open-source.
- Progress: See [docs/](docs/) for weekly logs.
- Projects: Check [projects/](projects/) for code (e.g., toy miner, Stratumv2 tool).
